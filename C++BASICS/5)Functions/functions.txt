Note 1 ==
We use functions to reduce the redundancy in the code if we have to perform some task on 
the repetitive basis then we just create a function and call it whenever required saving time 
and reducing redundancy

Note 2 == 
All functions are stored under stack memory at the bottom it is stored under the main function
and above that the functions we have created are stored
it is store in upward manner and when it provides the final output then the stack is empty

Note 3 == Pass by Value
Here the copy of the arguments is passed on to the functions
Here the address is not same both a,b declared in the main function and the function we have 
created is different
