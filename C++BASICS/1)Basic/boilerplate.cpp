#include <iostream> // it is prepocessor directive or say a <iostream> is header file that give access to functions declaration, macros, constants and libraries and lets you use standard input output features like cin,cout,endl
using namespace std; // lets you use cout,cin & endl without std:: in front of them
int main() // main function is the entry point every program starts from here
{
    cout<<"Let's start the journey"<<endl;
    return 0; // ends the program and returns 0 to OS means the successful execution 
}
