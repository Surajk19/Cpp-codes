break == In C++, when encountered, the break statement terminates the loop or switch statement,
and control returns from the loop or switch statement immediately to the first statement
after the loop.

continue == the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop,
and the control of the program goes to the next iteration.

goto statement == the goto statement is used to alter the normal sequence of program 
execution by transferring control to some other part of the program. 
The goto statement can be used to jump from anywhere to anywhere within a function.

return ==  The return statement is used to terminate a functionâ€™s execution and transfer 
program control back to the calling function. It can also specify a value to be returned
by the function. A function may contain one or more return statements.
